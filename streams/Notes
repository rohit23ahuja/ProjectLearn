Streams is a sequence of elements generating from source supporting parallel and sequential aggregate operations.
Source refers to - arrays, list, set. But not map.
Order of data in stream is same as the source.
Do not store data. 
Is a single use sequence of data.
IllegalStateException if we try reuse Stream. 
Get closed after use
Map Api does not have stream method
Intermediate stream operations are generally lazy in nature. ex - filter, map
Terminal operations return result and consume the stream.
Intermediate operations is executed only when terminal operation is called on it. terminal operations cannot be chained. 
all intermediate operations return stream.
sourceDataStructure.stream().allMatch,count,distinct,map,filter,foreach(INTERMEDIATE OPRATIONS).get,OrElse,filter,map,ifPresent,OfNullable(TERMINAL OPERATIONS)
