Objects that are equal as per equals must have same hash code.
Unequal objects can have same or different hash codes. However same hash codes for unequal objects effects performance in hash based collections.
Hashcode is an unique integer representation of an object.
Default implementation return an integer value by converting internal address of the object.
For equals method use getClass check. as instanceof check returns true for subtype as well.
