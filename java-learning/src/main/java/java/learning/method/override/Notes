Overriding is a feature in java that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation
 of a method that is already present in one of its parent or super classes.
overriding is run time polymorphism, overloading is compile time.
overriding conditions - 
	should have same name
	same number and data type of parameters
	same return type or sub class of return type
	access modifier should be same or can allow more than that of parent
	cannot make a static method as instance method or instance method as static in sub class
	if super class method does not throw checked exception, sub class overridden method can only throw unchecked exception
	if super class method does throw checked exception, sub class overridden method can throw no exception, same exception or sub class of exception thrown from parent.  
violating overriding rules generate compile time error
final methods cannot be overridden
